# AIM - axisymmetric inversion method

Code for computing equilibrium axisymmetric phase-space distribution function. It provides highly efficent and user-friendly implementation of the algorithm presented in [Hunter \& Qian](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/262/2/401/1161204), [Qian et al.](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/274/2/602/2896126) and [Petac \& Ullio](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.99.043003). The code is written in C++, however, it can be also be deployed from Python using the provided wrapper module.

## Requirements and installation

To compile the source code the following tools have to be installed on your system:
* gcc (recommended version 7.5 or later)
* GSL (recommended version 2.4 or later)
* cmake version 2.6 or later
* pybind11 version 2.5 or later (optional, needed for compiling the Python wrapper)
* Cpputest (optional, needed for compiling the Unit tests)
* doxygen (optional, needed for automatic generation of the documentation)

After cloning the repository you can build the project into subfolder "build":

```terminal
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make all
```

Note: if you do not wish to compile the Unit tests or Python wrapper you can remove the corresponding lines from _CMakeLists.txt_.

## Examples

The code can be used either from C++ or Python. While the Python wrapper provides modern and simple interface, running it from C++ allows for more control (mainly related to the accuracy of various numerical perscriptions). Futhermore, the C++ class structure allows for simple extension the code to new DM density profile, halo rotational properties and baryonic gravitational potentials.

#### C++

The code can be used in C++ as demonstrated in the following example (see main.cpp):


```c++
//Include the relevant source files.
#include "src/Observables.hpp"
#include "src/Inversion.hpp"
#include "src/Model.hpp"
#include "src/Structs.hpp"
#include "src/halos/Halo_NFW.hpp"
#include "src/halos/Halo_gNFW.hpp"
#include "src/halos/Halo_sABC.hpp"
#include "src/baryons/Baryons_H_2MN.hpp"


// Define struct with DM halo parameters.
// Here we asume spherical NFW density profile.
// First parameter is the scale density (in units of M_sol / kpc^3) while the second parameter is scale density (in units of kpc).
halo_2p p_nfw = {1e8, 13.};
// Initialize the DM halo object.
Halo_NFW halo(p_nfw);

// Define structs related to the baryonic distribution.
// In this example we assume a model consisting of two Myiamoto-Nagai disks (first parameter is the disk mass in units of M_sol,+ while the second and third parameters are scale length and scale height in units of kpc) and a spherical Hernquist bulge (first parameter is the bulge mass in units of M_sol while the second parameter is the scale lenght in units of kpc).
disk_3p disk1 = {5e10, 3.6, 0.5};
disk_3p disk2 = {0., 1., 1.};
bulge_2p bulge = {1e11, 1.};
// Initialize the baryonic model
Baryons_H_2MN baryons(disk1, disk2, bulge);

// Initialize the galactic model using the previously defined halo and baryons.
Model model(&halo, &baryons);

// Interpolate the PSDF obtained for the specified galactic model with given number of relative energy and angular momentum points.
Inversion psdf(&model, 500, 20);

// Initialize the class for computing various observable quantities from the PSDF (namely DM density and various projections of the velocity distribution).
Observables obs(&model, &psdf);

// Evaluate the DM density (computed numerically from the obtained distribution function) in 20 points along the radial direciton.
int nPts = 20;
double logRmin = -1, logRmax = 3.;
double Rpts[nPts], zpts[nPts], result[nPts];
for (int i = 0; i < nPts; i++) {
    Rpts[i] = std::pow(10., logRmin + (logRmax - logRmin) * i / (nPts - 1));
    zpts[i] = 0;
}
obs.rho(nPts, Rpts, zpts, result);

// Compute the local (R~8.122 kpc, z~0) velocity distribution of DM using 100 velocity points.
int nVel = 100;
double pv_mag[2 * nVel];
obs.pv_mag(nVel, 8.122, 0, pv_mag);
```

To add new baryonic or halo models add the corresponding source files in /src/halo or /src/baryons folders, respectfully. They have to extend the virtual parent class Halo.hpp or Baryons.hpp.

#### Python

To use the Python wrapper simply copy the AIM.so file in your project's directory. Example of its usage:

```python
import numpy as np
# Import the wrapper module.
import AIM

# Initialize a new instance of the phase-space distribution function (the argument controls weather you want verbose output or not).
f = AIM.PSDF(True)

# Setup a halo model with spherical NFW density profile.
f.setHalo('NFW', [1e8, 13.])
# Setup a baryonic model composed of Hernquist bulge and two Myiamoto-Nagai disks.
f.setBaryons('H_2MN', [5e10, 3.6, 0.5, 1e10, 2.5, 1., 1e10, 0.5])

# Compute the distribution function with a given number of relative energy and angular momentum points.
f.compute(500, 20)

# Compute the DM density profile from the obtained distribution function in 20 radial points.
Rpts = np.geomspace(1, 1000, 20)
zpts = np.zeros(20)
density_profile = f.rho(20, Rpts, zpts)

# Compute the local (R~8.122 kpc, z~0) velocity distribution of DM using 100 velocity points.
velocity_distribution = f.pv_mag(100, 8.122, 0)
```
